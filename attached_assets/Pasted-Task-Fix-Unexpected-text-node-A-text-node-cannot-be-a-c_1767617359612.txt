Task: Fix "Unexpected text node: . A text node cannot be a child of a View" Console Error

Problem Description:
A persistent console error appears on every page load: "Unexpected text node: . A text node cannot be a child of a <View>." This error comes from react-native-web when a View component has a raw text node (specifically a period ".") as a direct child instead of being wrapped in a Text component.

Error Context:

The error appears immediately after [Auth] Auto-synced data from cloud on app load
It occurs on the initial render before user interaction
The literal character being rendered is a period "."
Investigation Steps:

Search for conditional renders that could output a period:

Look for patterns like {condition && value} where value might be a string containing "."
Check for ternary expressions like {condition ? "." : null} or {condition ? something : "."}
Search for template literals that might evaluate to just "."
Check components that render during initial auth flow:

client/App.tsx - Main app wrapper and providers
client/navigation/RootStackNavigator.tsx - Initial navigation setup
client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx - Auth provider that logs the sync message
client/contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx or client/hooks/useSubscription.tsx
Any loading indicators or skeleton screens
Search for common patterns that cause this:

# Search for standalone periods in JSX
grep -rn ">\s*\.\s*<" client --include="*.tsx"
# Search for period at end of JSX expression
grep -rn "}\s*\.\s*{" client --include="*.tsx"
# Search for period in conditional render
grep -rn "&&\s*['\"]\\.['\"]" client --include="*.tsx"
# Check for text content ending with period followed by View close
grep -rn "\\..*</View>" client --include="*.tsx"
Check for numeric conditionals that might render "0" or similar:

{count && <Component />} where count=0 renders "0" as text
Fix with {count > 0 && <Component />} or {count ? <Component /> : null}
Look at these specific file patterns:

Badge components that might show "." for loading states
Separator/divider components
Breadcrumb or navigation indicators
Any component using dots for pagination or loading
Glass effect components or overlays
Use React DevTools debugging:

Open browser DevTools → Components tab
Search for any View component with a text child
Look for components rendering during auth/load phase
Fix Approach:
Once located, either:

Wrap the text in a <Text> component: <Text>.</Text>
Remove the decorative period if not needed
Fix the conditional to prevent the period from rendering as a bare text node
Files to Prioritize:

client/components/DrawerContent.tsx
client/components/GlassViewWithContext.tsx
client/App.tsx
client/navigation/*.tsx
Any component with blur effects or glass styling
Loading/skeleton components
