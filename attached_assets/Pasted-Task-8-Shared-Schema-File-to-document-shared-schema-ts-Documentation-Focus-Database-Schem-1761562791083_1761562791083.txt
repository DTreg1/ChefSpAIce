Task 8: Shared Schema
File to document:
* shared/schema.ts
Documentation Focus:
/**
* Database Schema & TypeScript Types
*
* Defines all database tables and type-safe schemas using Drizzle ORM.
* Shared between client and server for full-stack type safety.
*
* Tables:
* - users: User accounts from OIDC authentication
* - userInventory: Food items in user's storage
* - recipes: User-created and AI-generated recipes
* - mealPlans: Planned meals by date
* - shoppingListItems: Items to purchase
* - favorites: User's favorited recipes
*
* Type Generation:
* - Insert types: Created from Zod schemas (validation)
* - Select types: Inferred from table definitions (queries)
*
* Relationships:
* - All tables foreign-key to users.id for data isolation
* - Cascading deletes: [specify cascade behavior]

/**
* Users Table
*
* Core user accounts mapped from Replit Auth OIDC claims.
*
* Fields:
* - id: UUID primary key (maps to OIDC sub claim)
* - email: User's email from OIDC
* - name: Display name
* - storageLocations: JSONB array of {id, name, icon} objects
* Default: [Refrigerator, Freezer, Pantry, Counter]
* - createdAt: Account creation timestamp
*
* Indexes: [list any database indexes]
* Unique Constraints: email must be unique
*/

/**
* User Inventory Table (userInventory)
*
* Food items currently in user's possession.
*
* Fields:
* - id: Auto-generated UUID
* - userId: Foreign key to users.id
* - name: Food item name
* - quantity: Amount (e.g., "2", "1.5")
* - unit: Measurement unit (e.g., "cups", "lbs", "pieces")
* - storageLocationId: Where item is stored (from user.storageLocations)
* - expirationDate: When food expires (optional)
* - foodCategory: Category (Dairy, Produce, Meat, etc.)
* - nutrition: JSON string with NutritionInfo
* - barcodeId: Barcode number if scanned
* - imageUrl: Product image URL
* - weightInGrams: Numeric weight for nutrition calculations
* - createdAt: When item was added
*
* Business Rules:
* - Expiration alerts trigger 3 days before expirationDate
* - Nutrition scaled by weightInGrams vs serving size
* - Categories used for smart defaults and analytics
