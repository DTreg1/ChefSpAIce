Context
I'm working on adding a comprehensive appliance/cookware/bakeware library to the ChefSpAIce app so recipes can be tailored to what equipment users actually have available.

What's Already Done
Created database schema for:
appliance_library table - master catalog of all equipment
user_appliances table - tracks which items each user owns
Added needed_equipment field to recipes table
Created server/appliance-library-data.ts with 70+ items including appliances, cookware, bakeware, and utensils
Initialized the appliance_library table with data using server/init-appliance-library.ts
What Still Needs to Be Done
1. Fix Storage Layer (server/storage.ts)
Add these methods to IStorage interface and implement them:
getApplianceLibrary() - get all library items
getApplianceLibraryByCategory(category) - filter by category
searchApplianceLibrary(query) - search items
getCommonAppliances() - get common items for onboarding
getUserAppliances(userId) - get user's equipment
addUserAppliance(userId, applianceLibraryId, details) - add to user's collection
updateUserAppliance(userId, id, updates) - update user's item
deleteUserAppliance(userId, id) - remove from collection
getUserAppliancesByCategory(userId, category) - get user's items by category
2. Create API Endpoints (server/routers/appliances.router.ts)
GET /api/appliance-library - browse all equipment
GET /api/user-appliances - get user's equipment
POST /api/user-appliances - add to user's collection
PATCH /api/user-appliances/:id - update user's item
DELETE /api/user-appliances/:id - remove from collection
3. Update Recipe Generation
Modify recipe generation prompt to include available equipment
Add "Needed:" section to generated recipes listing required equipment
Filter recipes based on user's available equipment
4. Create Equipment Selection UI
Add new page at /equipment or /appliances
Show library items grouped by category (appliances, cookware, bakeware, utensils)
Allow users to select what they own
Add to onboarding flow for new users
Show common items pre-selected
5. Update Recipe Display
Show "Needed Equipment" section on recipe cards and details
Highlight missing equipment in red if user doesn't have it
Add filter on recipes page to show only recipes with available equipment
6. Testing
Test equipment selection and saving
Verify recipe generation includes equipment requirements
Test filtering recipes by available equipment
Current Issues
The server is running but there are TypeScript errors in server/storage.ts (61 diagnostics) that need to be fixed related to missing type imports for ApplianceLibrary and UserAppliance.

Please continue implementing this feature, starting with fixing the storage layer and completing all remaining tasks.
