✖ Check for common project setup issues
The .expo directory is not ignored by Git. It contains machine-specific device history and development server settings and should not be committed.
Advice:
Add ".expo/" to your .gitignore to avoid committing local Expo state.

✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating asset fields in /Users/home/Downloads/ChefSpAIce4/app.json:
 Field: Android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage - cannot access file at './assets/images/android-icon-foreground.png'.
 Field: Android.adaptiveIcon.monochromeImage - cannot access file at './assets/images/android-icon-monochrome.png'.
 Field: Android.adaptiveIcon.backgroundImage - cannot access file at './assets/images/android-icon-background.png'.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/

✖ Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: expo-asset
Required by: expo-audio
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependency with "npx expo install expo-asset"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without this dependency. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.

✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, scheme, userInterfaceStyle, ios, android, plugins, androidStatusBar.
