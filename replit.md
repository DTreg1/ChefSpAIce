## Recent Changes
- **2026-02-14**: API documentation audit and update. Added 3 missing endpoints (GET /api/version-check, POST /api/notifications/register-device, GET /api/analytics/waste-summary) to OpenAPI section files. Added deprecation notices for POST/DELETE /api/user/push-token. Added Version Check and Analytics tags to skeleton. Regenerated merged `chefspaice-api.openapi.yaml` (all refs valid). Created `docs/openapi/swagger.html` for interactive Swagger UI browsing. Merge script: `node docs/openapi/merge-openapi.js`.
- **2026-02-14**: Tablet-responsive layouts across 4 key screens. `useDeviceType` hook extended with `screenWidth` and `isLandscape` (uses `Dimensions.addEventListener` for dynamic orientation changes). InventoryScreen: 3-column grid with 320px/380px master-detail side panel. RecipesScreen: 2-column grid with 340px/400px recipe preview panel. MealPlanScreen: fixed 7-column week view using flex:1 distribution. SettingsScreen: split-pane with 280px/320px category list + scrollable detail. All phone layouts preserved unchanged.
- **2026-02-14**: Added OTA update system via `expo-updates`. `useAppUpdate` hook in `client/hooks/useAppUpdate.ts` listens for AppState foreground events, calls `Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()` (skipped in dev), and checks server `GET /api/version-check?currentVersion=X` for `forceUpdate` flag. `UpdateBanner` component (`client/components/UpdateBanner.tsx`) shows animated non-blocking banner matching OfflineIndicator patterns. On tap, fetches update and reloads app. Force updates show non-dismissable "Required update" banner. Server endpoint compares `currentVersion` against `MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION` using semver. `app.json` updated with `expo-updates` plugin, `runtimeVersion` (appVersion policy), and EAS Update URL.
- **2026-02-14**: Added `NetworkStatusProvider` using `@react-native-community/netinfo` for reliable connectivity monitoring. New `client/hooks/useNetworkStatus.tsx` creates `NetworkStatusContext` with `{ isConnected, isInternetReachable }`. `NetInfo.addEventListener` replaces fetch-failure-based detection. On reconnection (false→true), triggers `offlineMutationQueue` processing + `syncManager.fullSync()` with jitter delay and exponential backoff (2s→30s max). Added `syncManager.setNetworkStatus()` method for direct online/offline signaling from NetInfo. `OfflineIndicator` now consumes `useNetworkStatus()` context. `NetworkStatusProvider` wired in App.tsx inside `ThemeProvider`, outside `AuthProvider`. Backoff timers are cleared on disconnect and guarded by `connectedRef` to prevent stale retries during connection flaps.
- **2026-02-14**: Added `user_push_tokens` table and `registerForPushNotifications()` flow. Client gets Expo push token and POSTs `{ token, platform }` to `POST /api/notifications/register-device`, which upserts into the new table. All auth flows (signIn, signUp, Apple, Google) now trigger push registration after success. Server-side `sendPushNotification()` in `notificationService.ts` switched from `expo-server-sdk` to direct Expo Push API (`https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send`) and reads tokens from `user_push_tokens` instead of `users.expoPushToken`. `queueNotification()` (used by winback job) calls `sendPushNotification()` for delivery. Old `/api/user/push-token` route is deprecated but not yet removed.
- **2026-02-14**: Extracted business logic from 3 large router files into dedicated service modules. `recipes.router.ts` (1,741→383 lines) with `recipeGenerationService.ts` (1,359 lines) — consolidated duplicated fuzzyMatch/post-processing logic. `appliances.router.ts` (867→86 lines) with `applianceService.ts` (831 lines). `sync.router.ts` (895→83 lines) with `syncBackupService.ts` (865 lines). Routers now contain only HTTP plumbing (auth, parsing, response formatting, error handling).
- **2026-02-14**: Created `client/lib/api-client.ts` — a typed API client wrapper replacing 69 raw `fetch()` calls across 38 files. Provides `apiClient.get/post/put/patch/delete<T>()`, `postFormData<T>()`, and `raw()` methods with automatic auth headers, base URL resolution, `{success, data, error}` envelope unwrapping, `ApiClientError` typed errors, 401 auto-logout, `skipAuth`/`signal`/`timeout` options. Also migrated remaining `apiRequestJson` consumers. Only `query-client.ts` base implementation and local blob `fetch(imageUri)` calls remain as raw fetch.
- **2026-02-14**: Split 4 large files for maintainability (target: no non-data file >800 lines). OnboardingScreen.tsx (3,157→505 lines) split into 8 files in `client/components/onboarding/`. ChatModal.tsx (1,426→547 lines) split into 5 files in `client/components/chat/` + `client/hooks/useChatMessages.ts`. AuthContext.tsx (972→538 lines) with `client/lib/auth-api.ts` and `client/lib/auth-storage.ts` extracted. sync-manager.ts (1,073→786 lines) with `client/lib/sync-types.ts` and `client/lib/sync-conflicts.ts` extracted.
- **2026-02-13**: WCAG AA contrast ratio audit and remediation. Darkened AppColors (primary, secondary, accent, warning, success, error, confidence*, offline) for 4.5:1 contrast with white button text. Added brighter Colors.dark overrides for text on dark backgrounds. Switched light glass text to dark (#1a3a1a). Removed alpha transparency from GlassButton/VoiceQuickAction backgrounds. Added theme-level confidence/offline colors and migrated 7 consumer files from static AppColors to theme-based colors.
- **2026-02-13**: Added object storage recovery procedure documentation at `docs/object-storage-recovery.md`. Covers storage layout, three recovery options (AI re-generation, manifest export, secondary backup), and recommendation.
- **2026-02-13**: Added weekly `soft-delete-cleanup` background job that permanently deletes inventory items where `deletedAt` is older than 30 days. Aligns with UI's "recently deleted" feature and prevents soft-deleted rows from accumulating. Job file: `server/jobs/softDeleteCleanupJob.ts`.
- **2026-02-13**: Added retention offer duplicate prevention in `/apply-retention-offer` endpoint. Before creating a Stripe coupon, checks Stripe subscription discounts for active "Retention Offer" coupons and queries new `retention_offers` DB table for any offer applied in the last 6 months. Rejects with `RETENTION_OFFER_ALREADY_APPLIED` (409). New `retentionOffers` table tracks all retention offers for analytics.
- **2026-02-13**: Added server-side waste analytics endpoint (`GET /api/analytics/waste-summary`) that aggregates `userWasteLogs` and `userConsumedLogs` by week/month, calculates waste reduction scores, and tracks streaks (consecutive weeks with score >= 80). AnalyticsScreen fetches server data and displays weekly trend bar charts and streak badges with client-side fallback.
- **2026-02-13**: Replaced in-memory Map caches with database-backed `api_cache` table (key TEXT PK, value JSONB, expiresAt TIMESTAMP). New `DatabaseCacheStore` in `server/lib/cache.ts` implements `CacheStore` interface using DB upserts. `nutritionLookupService.ts` migrated from raw Map to `CacheService`. Daily `cache-cleanup` cron job deletes expired rows. Cache now survives server restarts.
- **2026-02-13**: Added Expo push notifications. Server uses `expo-server-sdk` to send push notifications after inserting into the notifications table. New `/api/user/push-token` endpoint for clients to register tokens. Token refresh runs automatically on app startup.
- **2026-02-13**: Consolidated all subscription tiers into a single STANDARD tier.

## System Architecture
The application features a modern UI/UX with an iOS Liquid Glass Design aesthetic, built using React Native and Expo for mobile, and React for web-based landing and administration pages. Key functionalities include an inventory system with swipeable cards and nutrition summaries, detailed recipe views, and a flexible meal planner. The backend is powered by Express.js, utilizing Drizzle ORM and a PostgreSQL database. AI capabilities for recipe generation, chat, and vision scanning are integrated via the OpenAI API. User authentication uses custom session tokens, supporting social logins (Google/Apple) and biometrics. Shopping list integration is handled by Instacart Connect, with nutritional data sourced from USDA FoodData Central. The architecture follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach, organizing business logic into domain types, entities, aggregates, and services for clear separation of concerns. Screens are lazy-loaded for optimized performance.
